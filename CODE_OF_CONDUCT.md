# Code of Conduct

## Shorter version
This project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
This code of conduct applies to project spaces, including the GitHub and Gitter, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the response team.

Some project spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

## Longer version
The project team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all project spaces, both online and off, including GitHub repos, any Slack, Gitter or other channels, work spaces at Hackathons, and anywhere else where work is being done on this project. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the response team.

Some project spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop. This includes being mindful that the project name "SCREW" could be construed to have sexual connotations. 
* Threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.

The project prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The response team reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:

* ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
* Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Reporting
If you are being harassed by a member of the project team, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the response team at @oneillkza.  We will respond as promptly as we can. 

If the person who is harassing you is on the team, ideally they would recuse themselves from handling your incident, but since we only have one person right now, it would be best if you approached an outside advocate to mediate on your behalf.

This code of conduct applies to project spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the project team outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by project members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the project based on their past behavior, including behavior outside project spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the project.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of project members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences
If participants are asked to stop any harassing behavior, in most cases this will be done so gently and with explanations of why it is problematic. Nobody is perfect and people make mistakes; participants are asked to take requests to stop behaviour receptively and without defensiveness. They are also asked to comply with the request to stop immediately. In most cases, further action should not be necessary. 

In more serious cases, such as where a participant poses an imminent danger to other participants or refuses to stop when asked to, the response team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all project spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other project members or the general public.
