# Docker containers for SCREW and SIDEARM workflows

https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/

The goal is to provide Docker containers for running individual tools in **SCREW** and **SIDEARM** workflows.
This github repository contains a set of **Dockerfile** descriptors and is designed to be linked by **Dockstore**.
In the future changes in this repository will automatically trigger a rebuild process in **Dockstore**.

The workflows are described in CWL and linked with the corresponding docker images using "Hints" section.
This section tells CWL runner to pull docker images from a public **quay.io** or **dockerhub.org** repository.

## The structure of container storage
The main path to container repositories is https://quay.io/organization/ncbi_hackathons

We created a hierarchy of **base** docker containers in order to simplify their maintenance:
* linux_base (ubuntu xenial)
* genomics_base (linux_base)

* epigenomics_base (genomics_base)
* screw (epigenomics_base)

* sra_base (genomics_base)
* sidearm (sra_base)

## Data containers
In addition we provide several **data** containers that can be combined with tool containers.

* Viruses 1.1
* XXXXXX GEO ??
